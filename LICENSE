The Tokenized IP License (TIPL)

Version: 0.1
Date: [Insert Date]
Governed by Token: [Insert token blockchain] [Insert Token Ticker] [Insert contract address]


================================================================================
1. DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

    - "The IP" refers to the source code, object code, documentation, and
      related assets contained within this repository or distribution.

    - "The Token" refers to the specific cryptocurrency or governance token
      identified by the Smart Contract Address defined in the header of this
      license.

    - "Token Holder" means any entity or individual possessing The Token on
      the associated blockchain.

    - "Controlling Party" refers to the legal person, DAO, or entity that
      currently holds the authority to determine the licensing terms of The IP.
      Initially, the controlling party is the copyright holder.

    - "Initial Terms" refers to the document (e.g., INITIAL_TERMS.md,
      LICENSE_TERMS.txt) included in this distribution that specifies the
      current usage rights, restrictions, and permissions for The IP.

    - "Purchaser" means any entity or individual who initiates a Tender Offer
      to acquire The Tokens.

    - "Tender Offer" means a public, verifiable offer to purchase The Tokens
      from any and all Token Holders at a fixed price per Token.

    - "Change of Control Event" occurs when a single Purchaser acquires
      ownership of strictly more than fifty percent (50%) of the total
      circulating supply of The Tokens through a Tender Offer.


================================================================================
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS (INITIAL TERMS)
================================================================================

This License acts as a governance wrapper over the specific usage rights
granted for The IP.

2.1 Initial Terms

Your rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
and/or sell copies of The IP are governed by the Initial Terms. The Initial
Terms may define different permissions for different files, directories, or
modules within The IP (e.g., specific files may be permissive open source,
while others are restricted under commercial terms). The default Initial Terms
for this repository are described in the file INITIALTERMS

2.2 Conflict of Terms

In the event of a conflict between the Initial Terms and this TIPL regarding
the usage of the IP, the Initial Terms shall control. In the event of a
conflict regarding ownership, governance, or the Tender Offer mechanism, this
TIPL shall control.


================================================================================
3. THE TENDER OFFER MECHANISM (BUYOUT CLAUSE)
================================================================================

The authority of the current Controlling Party and the validity of the Initial
Terms are subject to a buyout mechanism governed by the following terms:

3.1 Initiation of Tender Offer

Any party (the "Purchaser") may seek to acquire the intellectual property
rights of The IP and become the new Controlling Party by initiating a
smart-contract-mediated Tender Offer. The Tender Offer must:

    1. Be open to all current Token Holders.
    2. Specify a fixed Offer Price per Token.
    3. Include a legally binding commitment or smart contract escrow to
       purchase all Tokens tendered by Token Holders at the Offer Price.

3.2 Acquisition of Rights (Change of Control)

If, at the conclusion of the Tender Offer, the Purchaser has successfully
acquired and holds more than 50% (greater than fifty percent) of the Total
Circulating Supply of The Tokens, a "Change of Control Event" is deemed to
have occurred.

3.3 Effect of Change of Control

Upon the verification of a Change of Control Event:

    1. Transfer of Control: The Purchaser immediately becomes a Controlling
       Party defined in Section 1.
    2. Right to Cancel or Modify: The Purchaser gains the right to cancel the
       existing Initial Terms and issue new terms for The IP.


================================================================================
4. CONTINUITY OF EXISTING USERS
================================================================================

In the event of a Change of Control where the Purchaser cancels or restricts
the Initial Terms:

    1. Perpetual Licenses: If the Initial Terms previously granted a
       perpetual, irrevocable open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) for
       a specific version of The IP, the Purchaser acknowledges they cannot
       revoke rights already granted for past versions, but may restrict
       future versions.

    2. Revocable Licenses: If the Initial Terms granted revocable or
       conditional rights (e.g., Business Source License, Commercial
       Subscriptions), existing users shall be granted a grace period of
       ninety (90) days to negotiate new terms with the new Controlling Party
       or cease use of The IP.


================================================================================
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
================================================================================

THE IP IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
